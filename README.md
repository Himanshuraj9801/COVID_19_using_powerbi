COVID-19 Dashboard Analysis using Power BI Project Overview This project focuses on developing an interactive COVID-19 dashboard using Power BI to analyze global pandemic trends. 
 The dashboard allows users to explore key metrics, including the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time, with the ability to drill down by WHO region and country. The primary objective is to provide insights into how the pandemic has progressed and to identify significant trends, spikes, and declines in the data.

Key Features
Time Series Analysis: The dashboard tracks the progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths, offering visualizations that highlight weekly moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations. Users can observe how the situation has evolved across different regions and identify key patterns.

Geographical Visualizations: A map chart illustrates the intensity of COVID-19 cases globally, while country-wise case counts are displayed through bar and pie charts. These visualizations help users understand the distribution and impact of the pandemic on different regions.

Interactive Filtering: The dashboard includes a WHO region slicer, allowing users to filter data and focus on specific areas. Additionally, a monthly filter enables a more granular analysis, helping to identify critical periods of change.

Hierarchical Analysis: A hierarchy of WHO regions and countries is implemented, enabling users to drill down into the data and assess which regions are most affected.

Dataset and Tools
The project utilizes a COVID-19 dataset with fields such as date_reported, country, WHO_region, new_case, cumulative_case, new_death, and cumulative_death. Power BI Desktop is used for data visualization,.

Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive tool for analyzing COVID-19 data, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's global impact through intuitive visualizations and interactive features.
